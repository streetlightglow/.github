# Streetlight Glow

This 'organization' is just a sort of alternate profile I'll use to upload some repositories to.
(If I ever stop procrastinating and get to actually work on something)

Do you want to use anything I wrote? Don't forget to abide by it's license! :)

Also, for those who want to contribute, just push request your additions to the code, I'll review it an hopefully merge it into master.
In the case I disable push requests in some repos, just make a fork and have fun there :3
